<h5><p>William Carey (1761-1834), known as the Father of Modern Missions, was a pioneer of new-style of evangelism in India. William Carey implemented various methods to spread the gospel: preaching, teaching (in schools), and literature (translating the Bible into more than 35 languages). This written piece presents an account of William Carey who put his life at pledge for the sake of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p></h5>

<h5><p>Judson was a Baptist missionary who became the first North American Protestant missionary in Burma (Myanmar). Like other early missionaries, he was involved in translation work and church planting. He went to the field of India as a Congregationalist but, after much study of the Bible, became convinced that Baptist doctrine was more biblical. Because of anti-Western sentiment in India, he moved to Burma.

    It took him 12 years to see his first 18 converts. By the time he died he had established 100 churches with over 8,000 members. The Baptist churches of Myanmar celebrate “Judson Day” each year to commemorate his arrival in the country.</p></h5>

    <h5><p>Müller is known as a prayer warrior who started orphanages and preached heavily about the need for missionaries around the world. In his lifetime his orphanage in England took care of more than 10,000 children. He was instrumental in promoting the idea of “faith missions.” This is where missionaries are not supported by a denomination but by individuals and churches. He believed in never asking anyone for support, but trusting God to lay it on the person’s heart to support the need.</p></h5>
